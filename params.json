If a Match is found,\r\nMatchFactory yields a replacement command to Bash for execution instead.\r\n\r\nIf multiple Matches are found, MatchFactory will prompt you to select one.\r\n\r\n## What tricks can it do?\r\n\r\nJust about anything, really. MatchFactory currently knows how to:\r\n\r\n* change directories in your shell\r\n* run a rake task by name\r\n* open an arbitrary URL in your favorite browser\r\n* clone a git repository\r\n* download and unzip a tar(gz) file\r\n* run cucumber features by name\r\n* install a Ruby Gem\r\n\r\nMatchFactory is designed to be extensible. It is easy to add Matches to handle new\r\ninput. It's Ruby, so you have its power and expressive syntax at your disposal.\r\n\r\n## How does it work\r\n\r\nBash provides a mechanism to execute a shell function immediately prior to executing\r\na shell command. This is done by trapping the DEBUG signal. This shell function tests\r\nthe command about to be executed, and if it would result in a 'command not found'\r\nerror, it invokes the MatchFactory.rb file. If MatchFactory returns any text, this is\r\nevaluated by Bash instead of executing the original command.\r\n\r\n## How do I use it?\r\n\r\n### Install:\r\nI keep my configuration files in a ~/conf directory. Extract MatchFactory to your ~/conf\r\ndirectory and source the method-missing.sh file in your .bashrc. Adjust pathing according\r\nto your tastes and setup.\r\n\r\n### Usage:\r\ncopy/pasting bare URLs to the command line should now just work. Additionally,\r\nspecifying a full or relative path ending in '/' will 'cd' you to that directory.\r\n\r\nMatchFactory is Rake-aware. Assuming the output of rake -T:\r\n\r\n    > rake -T\r\n      rake about              # List versions of all Rails frameworks and the environment\r\n      rake test               # Runs test:units, test:functionals, test:integration\r\n\r\nThen you can just say 'about' or 'test', and rake will be invoked accordingly.\r\n\r\nSee the file matchheads.rb for more examples.\r\n\r\n### Caveats:\r\n* This is known to work on osx, with Ruby 1.9. YMMV.\r\n* Don't even think about installing something like this on a production system.\r\n* Use of the DEBUG trap in this fashion may jack up debuggers like 'gdb'.\r\n\r\n## Design Notes and Credits\r\nI first encountered this awesome and crazy idea through Geoffrey Grosenbach's\r\n[Peepcode Blog](http://peepcode.com/blog/2009/shell-method-missing).\r\n\r\nI was motivated to restructure his setup for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I didn't like seeing 'command not found' errors after successful method-missing()\r\ncalls.\r\n2. I wanted to easily affect the state of the parent shell (cd'ing, for example),\r\nwithout resorting to [black\r\nmagic](http://fvue.nl/wiki/Bash:_Passing_variables_by_reference#Appendix_A:_upvar.sh).\r\n3. The case logic seemed hard to maintain and ordering of the regex matches becomes\r\nimportant. What if I want multiple options to match?\r\n\r\nIn order to meet my goals, I needed to have Bash eval() the output from MatchFactory.\r\nThis makes for a slightly more complex method-missing function, but I feel the\r\ntradeoff is worth it.\r\n\r\nGetting Bash to skip execution of the original command requires a hack involving\r\nsetting the shell option 'extdebug', and returning a value >1. Per the BASH\r\ndocumentation, this simulates a RETURN trap.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright Â© 2012 Erich Smith\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this\r\nsoftware and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software\r\nwithout restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify,\r\nmerge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies\r\nor substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\r\nINCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\r\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
